	// This extension is quite different than a typical "Let's find the difference between two dates..."
	// scenario. We can't use a typical method of solving this, because we would get the number of 
	// whole days, rather than including all unique days. 
	//
	// First, we strip the time components from the date, preventing whole-day comparisons to be made.
	// Then, we take the difference and add 1, to compensate for the lost start day. 
	// But, by still including year, month, and day, we're able to accurately make comparisons even if we're 
	// comparing days: 31st and 2nd for example. No important context is lost.
	//
